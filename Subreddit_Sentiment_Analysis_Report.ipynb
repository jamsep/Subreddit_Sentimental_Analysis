       "' >\\tWhile Gunn and Safran are developing a new DC Universe, which includes the 2025 theatrical release “Superman: Legacy,” Reeves’ “The Batman Part II” will remain a standalone property and fall under the newly branded “DC Elseworlds” category. Gunn announced that any DC film or television series that is set outside of the main DC Universe will get the “DC Elseworlds” tag, exactly how DC Comics functions.\\n\\nhonestly, this is the best of both worlds for me.  Reeves gets to keep his own Batman series and expand and upon that, but we’ll still get a unified series of interconnected flicks with Gunn’s work.  Granted, they already sort of did this with Joker and the first Batman, but at least they’re making better efforts for the “DCU”(?) I read this article and saw the words “Superman: Legacy,” Reeves’\" and had something very different in mind. Great idea to just let things be “elseworlds”. Like personally I don’t even need a shared universe, just cool unique stories based on what the creators want to make Are they actually calling it part II because thatd be great Damn that\\'s too long but I\\'m excited and we still get a Penguin series Batman and Superman solo films only 3 months apart? Sign me the fuck up! Oh i love this. The elseworlds comics are so fun, too!\\n\\nEdit: LIVE ACTION DAMIAN WAYNE LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO Six hours long, and RLM won\\'t review it. The Batman Part II is such a simple and yet cool title. Calling these movies Elseworld is the smartest thing they could do. Now they can make anything. Heck they could release Batgirl under that banner. Any bets on the next villain? Damn that\\'s toooo far out. More than 2.5 years.\\n\\nInteresting to see the different release periods for Batman over the past few installments. The Nolan movies released in July. The BVS and The Batman released in March. Now we are moving to October. A Halloween themed Batman movie could be up. Maybe Reeves leans into horror. Could be very fun. Give me a Mr Freeze/ Court of Owls Batman movie set during Christmas time and I will buy a whole theater of tickets It has been 1/4 of a century (25 years) since we last saw Mr Freeze on the big screen. And as awful as that portrayal of him was I feel like this is the best opportunity for Matt Reeves to put his spin on the Mr Freeze character. Not doing so would feel like a huge let down in my eyes. Hell yeah, this film was amazing.\\n\\nI love that they\\'ll have a DC Elseword category for movies outside their DCU plans.\\n\\nCan get the best of both worlds I absolutely cannot wait for this. I’m glad that Gunn understands that what Reese is doing with Batman can co-exist outside of the DCEU plan. Phillip’s Joker will be branded as an Elseworlds project as well. Court of Owls is just too perfect for Part II This is my first time hearing about the J.J. Abrams Superman movie. When is Hollywood going to stop giving that guy franchises? He\\'s a hack. Here\\'s a crazy idea DC.  Just make movies that don\\'t suck.  Maybe try that.\\n\\nNobody cares about an extended universe.  You missed your window.  It\\'s done.  \\n\\nJust make good stuff.  Fuck the rest. I was literally watching the metro fight scene at work tonight. I watch it all the time. Just love the choreography and feel to it. Honestly the batman was actually a version i hoped for since the dark knigjt trilogy ended pattison did a amazing job for briging something different for once Court of Owls this time. Please. This is going to be special So they can do Elseworlds but can\\'t keep Henry Cavill there? I love this actually.  It opens it up to have cool stories that aren\\'t tied to their main narrative.  \\n\\nWhat I really want is a Batman R or hard PG-13 rated horror movie with Clayface or Man-Bat as the villain. Something with a Del Toro style. Hope they leave a bit more on the editing floor this time, could have trimmed a good half hour off that movie and made it a lot better. Pattinson is the best Batman we have ever had on screen. I’m so excited to see more. I\\'m surprised the Black Superman thing is still happening. Wow, a *second* movie based on a comic book?  Is this like... becoming a trend now? im not really a batman guy. ive seen every one made and pretty much disliked all of them.\\n\\ni am also not a fan, at all, of patinson because of twilight mostly.\\n\\nwhen i heard he is in The Batman, i was like, im not even gonna bother.\\n\\ngot bored one night, watched The Batman, and its my favorite one of them all. looking forward the the next one if hes in it. Batman was cool when he climbed buildings and creeper around criminals in dark alleys. But walking around a crime scene, in costume, that\\'s filled with cops just made him look goofy. Kinda like the Adam West Batman! Elseworlds is the key. \\nWe don’t need another MCU, it’s such a chore to keep up with. \\nJust keep making cool self contained stories with DC properties. I hope they put some money aside to pay for a few lightbulbs. Having the Elseworlds imprint for non-DCU stories is kind of a no-brainer, tbh YESSSSSS YAY Can\\'t wait to see what off the hook choice is going to be the next Joker.   I would be really surprised if they went with Phoenix for that. Elseworlds gives me hope for a red son movie some day I wonder how many DC reboots there will be by the time the movie comes out. Gonna be a special brand of ass Considering the hapless disarray every attempt at establishing a contiguous cinematic universe for DC Comics has been so far, pretty much everything in it has been \"Elseworlds\". First Batman movie I was bored to tears with.  At least I can sit through the Joel Schumacher films It might be good. It might be the best. It might be the best ever. But I am tired of comic books movies This is a great route. Stuff like *The Batman* and *Joker* work so much better if they don\\'t try to tie them to other major projects much outside of their own sequels or things that are direct spinoffs intended by the people involved with the movies to begin with.   \\n\\n\\nThat being said, I hope we get another interesting villain for *The Batman: Part II*. I really liked their reinterpretation of The Riddler and I like Robert Pattinson as a younger, darker, and more detective-y Batman. Would be cool to see something like new spin on the Holiday Killer mystery from The Long Halloween or an interesting take on a character like Clayface (leaning into the actor aspect and using prosthetics or something to commit crimes to get famous instead of being a literal clay monster), Mad Hatter (he could easily be portrayed as an obsessive child kidnapper/killer that drugs and manipulates his victims instead of hypnotizing them), or someone like Professor Pyg. I liked the Tim Burton films. Hell I enjoyed Batman & Robin.\\n\\nIt\\'s a ridiculous film and should be treated as ridiculous. Chris Nolan version was the best. Leave it alone. Stop trying to squeeze more money out of it. I just can’t sit through another one of these dark, plodding, way-to-serious Batman movies. IMO DC has already messed this up again.  Just make 1 successful universe first. Find 1 Batman, 1 Superman, etc and write one well thought out continuous story.  That alone should be a decade or more of movies.  \\n\\nSeriously marvel is literally printing money.  They are the example of doing it right. I hope he bulks up some.\\n\\nBatman looks weird skinny...he\\'s always portrayed as being just as muscular as Superman, and is supposed to be the peak of what human fitness can achieve. Imagine if Iron Man 1 released, then Iron Man 2. Then Iron Man 1 with a different actor as Tony Stark. Then Iron Man 1. Toss a capt America movie in there. Then Iron Man 1 yet again. And Marvel said, \"Don\\'t worry guys we\\'re totally gonna get to doing The Avengers some day here.\" \\n\\nThat\\'s how I feel DC movies have been for the past 10 years. WE WON 🙌\\n\\nWords cannot describe how sick “Part II” is as the title. Superhero movies still happening, huh... I know this won\\'t be popular but I have to be honest, im so tired of Super hero movies Ngl this version of batman is VERY dumb. He was being strung along and wasn’t able to figure out ANYTHING for himself. Everything was basically done FOR him. Riddler laid it all out, and this Batman couldn’t even build a basic profile of him, unlike literally any other batman.\\n\\nHe’s definitely not a good detective. On the other hand he’s at least a decent fighter compared to other movie batmen. \\n\\nI enjoyed the movie but it definitely feels like an amateur version of batman. The first one wasn\\'t even half the movie the Nolan first Batman was. Hopefully this next one will be the new dark knight. Pattinson’s portrayal of The Batman was meh. Imo Robert Pattinson in one film showed more range than Christian Bale\\'s Batman.\\n\\nPattinson stole the show in The Batman. Unpopular opinion. This Batman sucks. The Elseworlds label is a really cool way of doing branched off universes and projects not related to the core universe. It eliminates a lot of confusion as to if something is connected or not. Please just stop. The thing I hated most about comics, great. People used to joke that you needed a guide to understand the MCU but the MCU is just a series of movies going in a straight line, having a bunch of \"this count\" and \"this doesn\\'t count\" is just confusing. Another Batman “franchise” ? FFS, there is nothing left of this horse to beat. Every Batman movie they make us a hope to get the success of the Michael Keaton “Batman” films. If it’s a Superman film they hope for the success of the original Christopher Reeve “Superman” films. I just hope we can hear him and not get our ears blasted out every time someone shoots a gun nooooo no more batmans please just let it die I liked the Batman a lot when I watched it, although I was pretty certain it was gonna end soon and was feeling ready for bed…but there were forty minutes left.  The last forty were also good, it just felt like it could have ended very nicely when the crook got caught This is why DC will always fail. How do you keep Batman out of the main universe. They will probably make a shitty Batman for their main Universe and have 2 Batman franchises running concurrently which makes 0 fucking sense. I still haven\\'t gotten around to seeing the first one and I really feel no need too. I\\'m sorry but the Batman is a bottom 3 Batman film. It gets worse with repeated viewings. Anyone know if Joker 2 is still going? I hope it’s better than the last one… I had trouble making it through. The last one wasn\\'t worth a second viewing. I won\\'t watch Part II. A darker, grittier Batman. Zzzz Am I really the only one here who thought The Batman sucked and was both stupid and boring?\\n\\nI\\'m mildly shocked that some people in here sees it as the best Batman movie. Looks like we are stuck with soyman. I tried to keep an open mind, but I thought this movie managed to be WORSE than Batman (1966). At least that one had Bat-Shark Repellent... The DC dumpster fire…. One of my most hyped movies in the coming years. The first film was great! Definitely between that and dark knight for my favorite Batman movie. \\n\\nSomething I find a little interesting though is I feel like The Batman really didn\\'t have much of a cultural impact. The cultural impact of The Dark Knight was massive and it still carries onto this day. Even the dark knight rises had a huge cultural impact. I feel like everyone was talking about this movie in March 2022 and then it kinda just got left there. Writers room: how can we come up with a multiverse without using the word multiverse.... It was a great movie. But let’s be honest: nothing beats Batman Bale Just re watched the latest story and paid more attention to The Riddlers riddles. \\n\\nPost flood Gotham would be a great way to introduce swamp thing or Solomon grundy. Also the penguin would be a nice central villain.  If they keep focused on the mafia and justice department problems along with batmans new character motivations i think they got a nice series going The next batman will be a pitch black screen for 2 hours, described as “incrdibly edgy cinematography” I just want some good comic book Batman like the Tim Burton movies were. I’m not a fan of the ‘grounded’ versions all too much I’m so tired of Batman “Elseworlds” or shit we can’t fit anyplace else because we need room for James Gunn’s dick jokes and corny high school humor. Will Batman go to the gym, or learn some martial arts for the next one?  Or will it just be another four hours of a skinny guy punching people in the face? The Joker wasn\\'t the Joker at all.  The Joker is an insane criminal mastermind.   Phoenix played a socially inept incel with a tic.   And the sequel is going to be a musical???    And still, no Batman because he\\'s 5?   \\n\\nThe Batman was a passable attempt at imitating Nolan\\'s masterpieces,  but a skinny Batman with the worst fight scenes since Adam West was a serious disappointment. Maybe we’ll get lucky and they just don’t make this movie A Batman and superman project released the same year and not connected. What a mess. they really need to make a marvel/dc crossover where batman and spiderman kill each other. permanently. WBD/DC has learned nothing. It\\'s as reactionary as it always has been constantly trying to right a sinking ship. They\\'ve traded one style in Snyder for another in Gunn. This has all the same feel as when Snyder was given the keys to the kingdom and not in a good way. HOW BOUT \"THE BATMAN PART DON\\'T\" He will take on the sugar industry and big diabetes as the next villain! Hey DC ...do *Gotham By Gaslight* Fuck it, give Denis Villeneuve a Batman Beyond project. Idk why but I really like the \"Part II\" tacked on the title. It feels old-school and I hope they keep it. DC EW This Batman reboot really didn’t do it for me. He’s a skinny little thing. Batman should be imposing and tough. R-Pats is the opposite. Hope everyone else enjoyed it. Giving RP some time to bulk up If Gunn can pull off his vision, it give the MCU a run for it’s money DC should hire Kevin Smith to lead like Feige for Marvel It’s gonna be 7 hour unedited. It have scenes of Batman reading. Or sleeping. Or on the toilet. \\n\\nGod damn the first movie was long and boring. The Batman Part II: Electric Boogaloo Oh boy, new comic book movie. I’m sure this will be different from old comic book movie How many god damn Batman movies are there going to be? I wonder when Hollywood will go back to making original movies, getting tired of the 50 million super hero movies/remakes coming out The Batman (2022) is a good movie. First one sucked. Alot of pressure for this new batman, every one already likes Pattinson , so this new one will be compared heavily Nooooo. Well I know where I won’t spend money I think this is a good plan, although I’ve found the current crop of Elseworld movies (Joker and The Batman) to be completely overrated and boring. 20 fucking 25???? Dude don\\'t bother telling me until like 2024. Yeesh OMG so DC films get another rebrand and guess what it centers around Batman movies.\\n\\nWow, shocked Picakchu face! Please don’t. Pass. Such a vanilla Bat Man movie. Give Batman a rest for bit. Spider-Man too. All of them really. Do people really care for DC? I find it so uninteresting g with all the times that they\\'ve rebooted the franchise with new actors. I hope the script and editorial live up to the aesthetics this time. That last \"The Batman\" felt like some cross between an episode of Monk and a Prada cologne commercial. I was just waiting for \"The Batman\" to start touching lamps and parking meters as he walked around. I couldn\\'t even finish the first movie it was so bad. I\\'d never watch the 2nd. meh, first one was the absolute definition of \"being bored to death\". Matt Reeves is a good filmmaker but I don\\'t believe he\\'s good for a batman movie. You know, while I liked, The Batman, I can’t see myself watching it again. It was really no fun. Marvel films are thrilling and include moments of drama and comedy.  The Batman is so dour. How many times can they brainlessly rehash a brainless rehash ? Tbf, people ate F&F and Marvel up so I guess they\\'ll just keep on trying cause dummies stay profitable... It\\'s gonna be shame if we end up losing Margot Robbie as Harley. I hope she keeps playing the character somewhere in there. They should have kept Cavill as Superman for a DC Elseworlds film or two. Batmans not a real super hero. When are they diversifying batman? Great, another movie I’ll never see. I found the last one to be painfully boring and I generally live longer movies. Wasn’t a big fan of it but it was better than Shumackers Batman movies I guess. Probably for the best.\\n\\nAs much as it\\'s nice having superheroes in a shared universe, I think it just doesn\\'t work as well when it\\'s part of a blockbuster movie franchise, and those heroes are played by big name actors. It always has to be either a big event (eg Batman vs Superman, Spiderman No Way Home) or a tiny cameo (eg Nick Fury popping up across Marvel films) when there\\'s a crossover between two heroes. It\\'s expensive to get those actors to appear in other movies when they\\'re not the main star, and it can alienate people who don\\'t know the other franchise as well. It works a lot better in comics and cartoons when you can pretty much pull in whatever characters you want for a specific story.\\n\\nBatman vs Superman shows that Batman just doesn\\'t fit into the world of overpowered superheroes that well, even with a new version of Batman that had been written to fit into that universe. Much like the Dark Knight trilogy, Pattinson\\'s Batman just wouldn\\'t fit in a movie with Superman, The Flash, etc very well. And the latest Batman is much closer to the sort of Batman stories I\\'d like to see, so I\\'d rather they have the freedom to keep developing that in their own way, rather than having to find a way to make it fit with the wider DCU.\\n\\nIt does leave a whole bunch of questions though. Is this new DCU a continuation from Justice League or a complete reset? Seems like we\\'re getting new castings for Superman and Batman, but there are still some dangling threads from previous DCU films/shows, and characters with actors that worked really well in those roles. Will the new main universe films continue on from those, will those versions of the characters be dropped entirely, or will they become \"Elseworlds\"? I gathered it would be 2025 but man its a long wait, we gotta get through 3 whole summers, by the time this comes out, we would know how Stranger things ends, Umbrella Academy would be over, The boys would prob be finished, we\\'d have seen The Fallout series, likely the 2nd season of Last of us, be seeing a trailer for the 3rd season of house of the dragon, seen Deadpool in the MCU, Avengers Kang Dynasty etc. DC now has the potential to become even bigger and better than Marvel Studios. We’ll see how it goes. Glad to hear they are just doing the simple solution people have suggested a million times and copying the comics with else worlds and then a main DC canon.\\n\\nAlways thought the Snyder-verse would have been better as an else worlds franchise and not as a jumping off point for the main cinematic universe. It would have probably helped with backlash on the films as well if it they hadn’t been pushed as the DC cinematic universe.\\n\\nDC could have actually told multiverse stories like many of the large crisis events over the years and I hope this new DCU is paving the way for that. Crazy to me that marvel has leaned into the multiverse way more with the MCU when DC definitely has more iconic multiverse stories that have spanned decades. \"... Unless we find out we can get a tax break from not releasing it, in which case into the shredder it will go.\" Yikes, another 2 hours of poorly-lit video I\\'ll have to watch where every line is whispered.\\n\\nThis is the price I pay as a kid who grew up with Batman. Cool movie, terrible Batman. How do you have Batman outsmarted by the Riddler? Terrible I just watched the Batman last night. Not only is it the worst super hero movie I’ve seen it’s flat out the worst fucking movie I’ve EVER sat through.\\n\\nWhat an absolute shit movie to get a sequel DC trash They\\'re so obsessed with imitating the MCU that even their standalone films need some dumb ass \"universe\" branding. I have zero faith In DC anymore.. My last hope is in gunn because everything has been trash for the most part. The animated stuff is golden but otherwise not so much.. I’m glad we have to wait a bit to see it. \\n\\nI’m so burned out on the MCU and DCEU because theres something every month it seems and the quality is usually dog shit. Save for No Way Home and Peacemaker. I\\'m more excited for DC these days than Marvel Elseworlds is a wonderfully stupid, completely meaningless title to come up with. It\\'s so redundant. Keep James Gunn away from this Batman and everything will be fine after a great first entry in the series. # DC Elseworlds?\\n\\nSeriously thats the best they could do?\\n\\nFake and most definately \\\\[REDACTED\\\\] Will the remaining movies in the old DCEU fall under \"Elseworlds\"? Simple but cool name. I like this title tbh. The simpler, the better. I\\'ve been saying that\\'s how they should treat their cinematic universe for fucking YEARS. Hopefully that means the two Batmen can coexist. Unless Gunn decides to kill The Batman 3. YES! Awesome. There definitely haven\\'t been more than enough batman movies I’m really hoping we get Dick Grayson in this I need to rewatch the first one How come DC doesn’t expand outside of Batman/Wonder Woman/Superman when it comes to heroes? There’s like a few but never like marvel. A friend told me dc comic lore tends to be more gore like and morbid compared to marvel so it’s kept to a minimum. Dddddoes that mean we can have Cavill back? PLEASE! >In an unexpected development, Gunn and Safran announced that Batman will be portrayed by Michael Keaton while the role of Bruce Wayne will filled by Danny DeVito. I get some are sick of multiverse stuff, but how cool would a James Gunn Batman, Baleman, and Rob Pattman be\\n\\nNot for a cohesive story, but for my own personal enjoyment I\\'m hoping for Scarecrow as the villain. Crazy how the one movie with a very accurate Batman portrayal ends up being Elseworlds. I’m wondering what comic story they’ll loosely base the second ‘The Batman’ around. Seeing as Joker might be the main antagonist in the next one maybe they’ll do ‘The Man Who Laughs’ where it was Joker going around killing Gotham’s most important people and Bruce Wayne is on his list. DC Etc? or perhaps DC MISC ? It’s not a musical??? Excellent! Very glad that they are not roping Patterson\\'s Batman into a wider DCU, as I don\\'t think he would fit in with the big powers.\\n\\nThat they are calling it Elseworlds is great as well - seems like they are fully planning side things not part of the wider universe, which is great. I am not confident that we will get some of the Elseworlds stories made, but I\\'d love to see a [Pirate Batman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Leatherwing), or perhaps [Speeding Bullets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman:_Speeding_Bullets), on the big screen. ELSEWORLDS?!\\n\\nFUCK. YES.\\n\\nI really miss that imprint. So that means they will begin filming early next year? Just make it dark and vengeful and we’ll all be happy. I love that they want the actors to voice games and animation. That’s huge. I’m excited for the direction they are taking this. \\n\\nHaving said that it’s still somewhat strange to me that some of the current DCEU characters aren’t changing (Suicide Squad and Waller specifically), and then others, Cavill being the most obvious, are not. \\n\\nI’m also surprised to read that they are basically doing Man of Steel again. Same basic plot. I assumed Gunn was going to do something different. Guess not. Jesus Christ that’s a long time Buhhhhhhhh Buh Buh buh Too many part 2’s these days, give me some creative titles I can\\'t wait As long as they stop recycling the same tired stories I will be happy. He mentioned before he\\'d be against those labels.\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/10e1pyr/james_gunn_said_hed_be_against_labels_separating/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button Can I be in it thanks I will not care anymore in 2025. These timelines are ridiculous. And even darker than the first! Getting into advanced darkness territory! By the time this comes out I probably won\\'t give a damn. Shhh, nobody tell Zoë Kravitz, we can pretend we lost her number. 3 and a half years between movies that set up a sequel is annoyingly long. Taking bets on how many movies until WBD execs start demanding they get to put their fingers in the creative kitchen.\\n\\nDC cinematic universe has always had a prideful corporate executive problem, not really a creative problem. Oh nice. IMO Elseworlds has some damn great tales. I just hope they don\\'t destroy Red Son or Gotham by Gaslight. Don’t fuck this up I’m sure there’s people happy that this is being released but to me this just spells disaster. I mean, DC couldn’t even keep their stories and characters accessible to begin with. Almost everything was dumping you right in the middle of some veteran superheroes life and expecting you to just know everything or expecting you to have prior knowledge so they could skip setting things up properly. It’s the reason things fell apart leading to this reboot and now they’re expecting people to follow two different Batman continuities? They really haven’t learned their lesson from last time. This is great because I really dug The Batman and thought Pattinson did a good job. So it not part of the DCEU? What in the actual fuck? That’s too long between releases. Isnt this like part 18 or some shit? Just don’t use that actor as the Joker used in the end and deleted scene. He was a copycat of Ledger. How come there’s no movies when Batman gets old, like he’s 75!? Damn I hope I get to watch this Runnin and Gunnin, I wish him the best It is so late. I’m so damn tired of new batman movies/shows. DC’s new “This Better Work Or Elseworlds” series. Long as the quality keeps coming I can’t complain. But why wait so long!?! Wonder if they’ll use elseworlds as a way to eventually do multiverse for DCU. One mentions a black Superman who is from Earth-23 so would be cool DC is really getting their shit together. I’m excited. I want Mr. Freeze as the villain.  I’d be fascinated to see what Reeves could do with that character. Based on the new lineup, I would call that DCU the Elseworlds project and The Batman as the main universe. 3 years?! 3 years! 3 years. Is anyone else thinking that they should\\'ve pushed more to have Joaquin Phoenix as the joker for the next movie? It was a shame that he didn\\'t want to continue playing that role, both movies (the joker and the batman) felt very similar, they would have made a great beginning if they would have had choose this 2 movies to convey for a bigger story ala Marvel Avengers/thanos. I hope it’s dark and gritty. why are they so keen on making a DCU? aren\\'t the joker and the batman their biggest hits so far? Ladies and gentlemen, I just shit my pants. So that\\'s what they call a DC movie too successful for James Gunn to take over... Hopefully not as bloated cause it\\'s probably the best film Batman (like gadgets and true to character) A close friend of mine many many years ago was a Batman fanatic and used to collect the elseworlds graphic novels. Man there were some great stories. So much material to work with, this will be great [deleted] You dont have to make this movie, i dont mind if you do something else instead. Didn\\'t they learn from universal ?\\n\\nDon\\'t name.your extended universe before it\\'s actually operational. How many times are DC going to reboot their EU they should just not bother none of it has been any good and now that cavil is out it\\'s gonna suck. 2025 still feels like it\\'s 20 years away.\\n\\nGetting old sucks. I have two questions. \\n\\nHow will it be a \\'Legacy\\' when it will be a fresh face Superman? Whose Legacy is it? \\n\\nWhy the hell are we getting a Damian Wayne in a New Batman movie? This will mean Batman would be in at least his 40s. I thought the idea was to get young people. Batfleck could have played this part. Part 1 was boring. Cavill and Affleck were completely fine as Superman and Batman. It\\'s just that the movies lacked certain thing. IDK what, probably more color.\\n\\nI just want 3 parallel Superman / Batman movies, is that too much to ask? Gawd, that\\'s a long ways away... Still haven\\'t gotten into the first one enough to finish it. Did anyone finish the first one? Is the \"worlds greatest detective\" going to actually solve anything or will the characters around him keep giving him the answers. Goddamnit, another cinematic offshoot. And it\\'s not coming for 2 more years. I know it’s because I’m just waking up and I’m dumb.  But I thought this was a continuation of the animated series and got excited.  Then I realized it’s for the movie and was only kind of excited. Just to clarify, all the DCEU movies upto this point starting from Man of Steel upto Black Adam(including JL and the 2 Suicide Squads) and the Peacemaker TV series are jow rebranded DCU and movies like Reeves\\' batman and the Phoenix Joker movies will be DC elseworlds along with all the animated works, CW shows and Titans and stuff right? We need a 30 year break from batman.  It is such a tired and dull character.  Reboot some other story we have done multiple times. Maybe the 6th version of invasion of the Body Snatchers.  That would be less played than the 100th version of Batman. The only way we can solve this crisis is to be Superman 4: The Quest for Peace. I hope Gunn swerves everyone and the new Batman is like a What If where Aunt Harriet is Batman instead of Bruce. This is one of the main reasons why I stopped reading comics back in the day. It\\'s freaking confusing having to figure out what ties in with what and how. Maybe I\\'m just getting old, I dunno. \\n\\nAs excited as I am for more comic book movies, it\\'s getting to be too much. I just want more young justice \\n\\nIf this Batman movie gets to Continue then let young justice live It might be an unpopular opinion, but I absolutely loved The Batman.  I felt Pattinson exemplified a young, chaotic Batman perfectly.  The horror atmosphere was the perfect tone for the actor and place in the Bruce Wayne chronology.  \\n\\n\\nI\\'m really hopeful that the writers are able to lean into the story\\'s role within the Batman lore.    \\n\\n\\nAs much as I love B:TAS and the DKT for their camp and action respectively, a dark, haunting emotionally intimate look into Bruce and Selena (and Jim and Alfred) is my ideal.  \\n\\n\\nJust please don\\'t undercut it with a goofy villain.  Let\\'s aim for closer to Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow than Jim Carrey as The Riddler. I really wasn\\'t a fan of this movie.\\n\\nThere was very little character growth or reason to care for Batman/Alfred/Catwoman. The movie had like 2 very short scenes with Alfred before he gets bombed; was I supposed to care about him at that point when he had maybe 3 minutes of screen time beforehand? Batman and the police are extremely incompetent and didn\\'t consider where the Riddlers\\' pictures were taken near the beginning(Oh wow he\\'s in that random apartment across the street / terrible detective work).\\n\\nThe Riddler was an interesting villain in the beginning, but loses steam quickly and has very little actual screen time(not fleshed out and was a retread of Heath\\'s Joker(purposely getting caught and interrogation in jail). It was way too long and should have been shorter given the amount of unnecessary scenes the movies seems to have.(Batman slowly walking across the screen for the 20th time.) Overall it was a 5/10 in my opinion. I don\\'t like the idea of a sequel to a movie that was so bad Don’t you kids ever get tired of these comic book movies? As a very very light fan of comics these days and someone who basically saw the Michael Keaton batmen and the Nolan ones...\\n\\nI have no clue what keeps happening with batman. Is there enough going on to keep doing the movies over and over?\\n\\nLike I\\'m not shitting on the franchise but I don\\'t understand why I should watch these extra new ones I hope they bring back Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy! It being separate like the Nolan movies honestly is making me care less for Reeves Batman. Personally I feel like this was the perfect starting point for a new universe. I loved the first movie, but I loved it because of how much it honored the comics. This being separated from Superman does not do the character justice. If I want a grounded Batman I have 3 Christopher Nolan movies. I thought we moved past this. Yuck I hope Gunn doesn’t destroy it with his shitty “humor”. Do we get Batbob and Joaquer? I am super excited for that union. 4 years in between movies..? This studio is a fucking nightmare Kinda feels like a missteps not to include the prestige film corner of the DC movies into your core content plan. I’m excited, I think twilight makes the best Batman since Keaton I think the title is a little misleading. I think it should be called The Batman: The Animated Series Part II. So this is like DC Rebirth.. \\n\\nIt’s also alot like what they’ve been doing with the Animated films / projects where they tell a overall story where the films are connected and they lead into huge events But also have the side projects that tell stories that aren’t connected to the overall Main story. And even have a film that’s part of a Universe that’s ONLY been established in Video Games and nowhere else as the case with ‘Batman: Assault on Arkham’ which takes place in the Arkham universe. \\n\\nThis is actually a really cool / interesting way to go forward and only benefits the fans as well get some unique stories from creators like we have with ‘The Batman’ & ‘Joker’ where they are self contained stories as the creators only had to focus on telling the story they wanted to tell and weren’t forced in trying to make it fit into the overall Storyline of the DCU, with projects able to take place outside of the DCU it only makes for alot more creative freedom which leads to more unique films. \\n\\nHowever I feel like this can get confusing and fast especially to the Average movie goers as I’m sure we’re going to get to a point where there’s multiple actors portraying Batman on the big screen with one telling a self contained story that doesn’t link to anything but their films and one that will essentially be Thee Batman that if it goes like the MCU will be a founding member of the JLA. PLUS I feel it could also get out of hand and become way more confusing when the elseworlds stories that are originally self contained, begin to split into its own Universe type of thing like what were now seeing with ‘The Batman’ where we’ll get a Part 2 and a HBO Max Show which I’m sure will only lead into more projects based off a Batman that’s not the Mainline Batman. And the same is potentially happening with ‘Joker’ as we now have a Part 2 and if that does good I can see a show based off maybe Harley. IF it goes that way I feel that this is about to get out of hand fast. \\n\\nBut damn if this all culminated in a Big Budget Big Screen version of ‘Crisis on Infinite Worlds’ where EVERYONE comes back THAT will be fucking EPIC and will be potentially as good as the final battle in Marvels Endgame. And it’s where we will potentially get a lot of fan favorites back again such as Cavils Superman, Bale’s Batman, Grant’s Flash, Gadot’s Wonder Woman etc etc. for thee longest time THAT is what I’ve been wanting to see. Maybe even get some that didn’t happen and older versions such as Clooneys Bat Nipples, Keatons Batman, freakin NICK CAGES Superman (hahaha) and possibly even get to see some Voice Actors suited up as their respective versions such as Jensen Ackles Red Hood (He did a photo shoot of Red Hood one year and it looked fucking amazing. Tara Strong’s Harley Quinn (She already portrayed Harley in Live Action in one of the Shows I don’t remember which). \\n\\nAll sounds amazing and has been what I’ve wanted to see for years so I’m stoked although sadly we won’t get the 1 project I wanted thee Most and that’s seeing Kevin Conroy as Old Batman for maybe a ‘Dark Knight Returns’ or even having him as thee Batman that sits around in the batcave and helps lead / coordinate the Bat Family or trains Terry McGinnis in a live action ‘Batman Beyond’\\n\\nTLDR: So Many projects and eventually will end up seeing multiple actors portraying the same Character can get confusing but if this is all leading to a Live action Big Budget version of “Crisis on Infinite Worlds” where they all link up for 1 HUGE film and we get to see some fan favorites return (Cavil & Bale) and see some older actors back as older versions of their character (Keaton & Clooney) see some that didn’t make it to the big screen like (Nick Cage as Superman) and possibly even get to see Voice actors suited up, and some from the Shows like (Grant’s Flash) would be pretty cool. …..elseworlds?'"

leaning actor aspect using prosthetics something commit crimes get famous instead literal clay monster mad hatter could easily portrayed obsessive child kidnapper killer drugs manipulates victims instead hypnotizing someone like professor pyg liked tim burton films hell enjoyed batman robin ridiculous film treated ridiculous chris nolan version best leave alone stop trying squeeze money sit another one dark plodding way serious batman movies imo dc already messed make 1 successful universe first find 1 batman 1 superman etc write one well thought continuous story alone decade movies

one hyped movies coming years first film great definitely dark knight favorite batman movie something find little interesting though feel like batman really much cultural impact cultural impact dark knight massive still carries onto day even dark knight rises huge cultural impact feel like everyone talking movie march 2022 kinda got left writers room come multiverse without using word multiverse great movie let honest nothing beats batman bale watched latest story paid attention riddlers riddles post flood gotham would great way introduce swamp thing solomon grundy also penguin would nice central villain keep focused mafia justice department problems along batmans new character motivations think got nice series going next batman pitch black screen 2 hours described incrdibly edgy cinematography want good comic book batman like tim burton movies fan grounded versions much tired batman elseworlds shit fit anyplace else need room james gunn dick jokes corny high school humor batman go gym learn martial arts next one another four hours skinny guy punching people face joker joker joker insane criminal mastermind phoenix played socially inept incel tic sequel going musical still batman 5 batman passable attempt imitating nolan masterpieces skinny batman worst fight scenes since adam west serious disappointment maybe get lucky make movie batman superman project released year connected mess really need make marvel dc crossover batman spiderman kill permanently wbd dc learned nothing reactionary always constantly trying right sinking ship traded one style snyder another gunn feel snyder given keys kingdom good way bout batman part take sugar industry big diabetes next villain hey dc gotham gaslight fuck give denis villeneuve batman beyond project idk really

face please pass vanilla bat man movie give batman rest bit spider man really people really care dc find uninteresting g times rebooted franchise new actors hope script editorial live aesthetics time last batman felt like cross episode monk prada cologne commercial waiting batman start touching lamps parking meters walked around even finish first movie bad never watch 2nd meh first one absolute definition bored death matt reeves good filmmaker believe good batman movie know liked batman see watching really fun marvel films thrilling include moments drama comedy batman dour many times brainlessly rehash brainless rehash tbf people ate f f marvel guess keep trying cause dummies stay profitable gonna shame end losing margot robbie harley hope keeps playing character somewhere kept cavill superman dc elseworlds film two batmans real super hero diversifying batman great another movie never see found last one painfully boring generally live longer movies big fan better shumackers batman movies guess probably best much nice superheroes shared universe think work well part blockbuster movie franchise heroes played big name actors always either big event eg batman vs superman spiderman way home tiny cameo eg nick fury popping across marvel films crossover two heroes expensive get actors appear movies main star alienate people know franchise well works lot better comics cartoons pretty much pull whatever characters want specific story batman vs superman shows batman fit world overpowered superheroes well even new version batman written fit universe much like dark knight trilogy pattinson batman fit movie superman flash etc well latest batman much closer sort batman stories like see rather freedom keep developing way rather find way make fit wider dcu leave whole bunch questions though new dcu continuation justice league complete reset seems like getting new castings superman batman still dangling threads previous dcu films shows characters actors worked really well roles new main universe films continue versions characters dropped entirely become elseworlds gathered would 2025 man long wait gotta get 3 whole summers time comes would know stranger things ends umbrella academy would boys would prob finished seen fallout series likely 2nd season last us seeing trailer 3rd season house dragon seen deadpool mcu avengers kang dynasty etc dc potential become even bigger better marvel studios see goes glad hear simple solution people suggested million times copying comics else worlds main dc canon always thought snyder verse would better else worlds franchise jumping point main cinematic universe would probably helped backlash films well pushed dc cinematic universe dc could actually told multiverse stories like many large crisis events years hope new dcu paving way crazy marvel leaned multiverse way mcu dc definitely iconic multiverse stories spanned decades unless find get tax break releasing case shredder go yikes another 2 hours poorly lit video watch every line whispered price pay kid grew batman cool movie terrible batman batman outsmarted riddler terrible watched batman last night worst super hero movie seen flat worst fucking movie ever sat absolute shit movie get sequel dc trash obsessed imitating mcu even standalone films need dumb ass universe branding zero faith dc anymore last hope gunn everything trash part animated stuff golden otherwise much glad wait bit see burned mcu dceu theres something every month seems quality usually dog shit save way home peacemaker excited dc days marvel elseworlds wonderfully stupid completely meaningless title come redundant keep james gunn away batman everything fine great first entry series dc elseworlds seriously thats best could fake definately redacted remaining movies old dceu fall elseworlds simple cool name like title tbh simpler better saying treat cinematic universe fucking years hopefully means two batmen coexist unless gunn decides kill batman 3 yes awesome definitely enough batman movies really hoping get dick grayson need rewatch first one come dc expand outside batman wonder woman superman comes heroes like never like marvel friend told dc comic lore tends gore like morbid compared marvel kept minimum dddddoes mean cavill back please unexpected development gunn safran announced batman portrayed michael keaton role bruce wayne filled danny devito get sick multiverse stuff cool would james gunn batman baleman rob pattman cohesive story personal enjoyment hoping scarecrow villain crazy one movie accurate batman portrayal ends elseworlds wondering comic story loosely base second batman around seeing joker might main antagonist next one maybe man laughs joker going around killing gotham important people bruce wayne list dc etc perhaps dc misc musical excellent glad roping patterson batman wider dcu think would fit big powers calling elseworlds great well seems like fully planning side things part wider universe great confident get elseworlds stories made love see pirate batman perhaps speeding bullets big screen elseworlds fuck yes really miss imprint means begin filming early next year make dark vengeful happy love want actors voice games animation huge excited direction taking said still somewhat strange current dceu characters changing suicide squad waller specifically others cavill obvious also surprised read basically man steel basic plot assumed gunn going something different guess jesus christ long time buhhhhhhhh buh buh buh many part 2 days give creative titles wait long stop recycling tired stories happy mentioned labels thanks care anymore 2025 timelines ridiculous even darker first getting advanced darkness territory time comes probably give damn shhh nobody tell zo kravitz pretend lost number 3 half years movies set sequel annoyingly long taking bets many movies wbd execs start demanding get put fingers creative kitchen dc cinematic universe always prideful corporate executive problem really creative problem oh nice imo elseworlds damn great tales hope destroy red son gotham gaslight fuck sure people happy released spells disaster mean dc even keep stories characters accessible begin almost everything dumping right middle veteran superheroes life expecting know everything expecting prior knowledge could skip setting things properly reason things fell apart leading reboot expecting people follow two different batman continuities really learned lesson last time great really dug batman thought pattinson good job part dceu actual fuck long releases isnt like part 18 shit use actor joker used end deleted scene copycat ledger come movies batman gets old like 75 damn hope get watch runnin gunnin wish best late damn tired new batman movies shows dc new better work elseworlds series long quality keeps coming complain wait long wonder use elseworlds way eventually multiverse dcu one mentions black superman earth 23 would cool dc really getting shit together excited want mr freeze villain fascinated see reeves could character based new lineup would call dcu elseworlds project batman main universe 3 years 3 years 3 years anyone else thinking pushed joaquin phoenix joker next movie shame want continue playing role movies joker batman felt similar would made great beginning would choose 2 movies convey bigger story ala marvel avengers thanos hope dark gritty keen making dcu joker batman biggest hits far ladies gentlemen shit pants call dc movie successful james gunn take hopefully bloated cause probably best film batman like gadgets true character close friend mine many many years ago batman fanatic used collect elseworlds graphic novels man great stories much material work great deleted dont make movie dont mind something else instead learn universal name extended universe actually operational many times dc going reboot eu bother none good cavil gonna suck 2025 still feels like 20 years away getting old sucks two questions legacy fresh face superman whose legacy hell getting damian wayne new batman movie mean batman would least 40s thought idea get young people batfleck could played part part 1 boring cavill affleck completely fine superman batman movies lacked certain thing idk probably color want 3 parallel superman batman movies much ask gawd long ways away still gotten first one enough finish anyone finish first one worlds greatest detective going actually solve anything characters around keep giving answers goddamnit another cinematic offshoot coming 2 years know waking dumb thought continuation animated series got excited realized movie kind excited clarify dceu movies upto point starting man steel upto black adam including jl 2 suicide squads peacemaker tv series jow rebranded dcu movies like reeves batman phoenix joker movies dc elseworlds along animated works cw shows titans stuff right need 30 year break batman tired dull character reboot story done multiple times maybe 6th version invasion body snatchers would less played 100th version batman way solve crisis superman 4 quest peace hope gunn swerves everyone new batman like aunt harriet batman instead bruce one main reasons stopped reading comics back day freaking confusing figure ties maybe getting old dunno excited comic book movies getting much want young justice batman movie gets continue let young justice live might unpopular opinion absolutely loved batman felt pattinson exemplified young chaotic batman perfectly horror atmosphere perfect tone actor place bruce wayne chronology really hopeful writers able lean story role within batman lore much love b tas dkt camp action respectively dark haunting emotionally intimate look bruce selena jim alfred ideal please undercut goofy villain let aim closer cillian murphy scarecrow jim carrey riddler really fan movie little character growth reason care batman alfred catwoman movie like 2 short scenes alfred gets bombed supposed care point maybe 3 minutes screen time beforehand batman police extremely incompetent consider riddlers pictures taken near beginning oh wow random apartment across street terrible detective work riddler interesting villain beginning loses steam quickly little actual screen time fleshed retread heath joker purposely getting caught interrogation jail way long shorter given amount unnecessary scenes movies seems batman slowly walking across screen 20th time overall 5 10 opinion like idea sequel movie bad kids ever get tired comic book movies light fan comics days someone basically saw michael keaton batmen nolan ones clue keeps happening batman enough going keep movies like shitting franchise understand watch extra new ones hope bring back uma thurman poison ivy separate like nolan movies honestly making care less reeves batman personally feel like perfect starting point new universe loved first movie loved much honored comics separated superman character justice want grounded batman 3 christopher nolan movies thought moved past yuck hope gunn destroy shitty humor get batbob joaquer super excited union 4 years movies studio fucking nightmare kinda feels like missteps include prestige film corner dc movies core content plan excited think twilight makes best batman since keaton think title little misleading think called batman animated series part ii like dc rebirth also alot like animated films projects tell overall story films connected lead huge events also side projects tell stories connected overall main story even film part universe established video games nowhere else case batman assault arkham takes place arkham universe actually really cool interesting way go forward benefits fans well get unique stories creators like batman joker self contained stories creators focus telling story wanted tell forced trying make fit overall storyline dcu projects able take place outside dcu makes alot creative freedom leads unique films however feel like get confusing fast especially average movie goers sure going get point multiple actors portraying batman big screen one telling self contained story link anything films one essentially thee batman goes like mcu founding member jla plus feel could also get hand become way confusing elseworlds stories originally self contained begin split universe type thing like seeing batman get part 2 hbo max show sure lead projects based batman mainline batman potentially happening joker part 2 good see show based maybe harley goes way feel get hand fast damn culminated big budget big screen version crisis infinite worlds everyone comes back fucking epic potentially good final battle marvels endgame potentially get lot fan favorites back cavils superman bale batman grant flash gadot wonder woman etc etc thee longest time wanting see maybe even get happen older versions clooneys bat nipples keatons batman freakin nick cages superman hahaha possibly even get see voice actors suited respective versions jensen ackles red hood photo shoot red hood one year looked fucking amazing tara strong harley quinn already portrayed harley live action one shows remember sounds amazing wanted see years stoked although sadly get 1 project wanted thee seeing kevin conroy old batman maybe dark knight returns even thee batman sits around batcave helps lead coordinate bat family trains terry mcginnis live action batman beyond tldr many projects eventually end seeing multiple actors portraying character get confusing leading live action big budget version crisis infinite worlds link 1 huge film get see fan favorites return cavil bale see older actors back older versions character keaton clooney see make big screen like nick cage superman possibly even get see voice actors suited shows like grant flash would pretty cool elseworlds feel like wig departments film either taken step back focussed hairlines start balding trying say never see people hairlines crisp real life anyways wait good seeing michael mann film

developers getting squeezed ip bigger corporations repress creativity bottom line approach climax movie relies cheaply imo well known characters marvel cinematic universe bearing story resolve

blanchett vs yeoh award funny take step back appreciate absurdity awards one spend millions lobbying voters considered suspicious one grace randolph shambles academy annoyed bigger film actor dumping time circle jerk party honestly idea andrea whole debacle looked realised seen like dozen different films shows realise roles played actress hope whole situation affect negatively caeer wise personal

lol media creating fake outrage people actually watch oscar serious question two snubs african american would anyone care people focusing criticism academy broken system riseborough probably would one locks early studio money push like everyone else getting nom came director wife knowing right people instead quality performance whole thing epitome hate player hate game absolutely reason nomination

shocked shocked tell utterly stupid reactions including less calling individual actors praised racist academy investigation lmao people suck lemon kind things oscars trying stay relevant getting worse instead literally stuffing money people pocket secure vote investigation people encourage others watch movie k someone investigate people still think oscars relevant still salty probably unintentionally ended causing deadwyler get pushed even though terms performance ana would probably hopefully eats cate blanchett voteshare leads michelle yeoh winning oscar wonderful role nuanced good anything situation underlines lazy unimaginative average oscar voter never gonna watch movie grossed 27k theatrically unless literally get celebrity grab ears tell watch embarrassing studios behind acceptable candidates mad movie bypassed usual oscar campaigns run cost movie entire sub 1m budget good deserves hope wins crazy things people waste time investigating good hope wins fuck oscar going grassroots campaign oh kiss ring going look disqualifying lot frustrations nomination come belief pushed two deserving woc speculated nominated know maybe great movie could fact shows insular academy become nominate movie one seen almost one would seen otherwise movies going make huge returns inevitable mass release comes see taste makers thought good alone kinda exposes whole issue group actors using awards hype movies make bet awards tell lol oscars politics anyway dumbest ever want win mess stopped caring oscar awards given quality work color skin body work earned implied prejudice

read original short story analog mag kid read almost everything osc done since said absolutely fucking furious put surprise twist ending fucking trailer never forgive asshats green lit fucking idiots frankly works best book really find 6 year old play bean film elementary school age based movies would siblings end interesting dynamic later would great see forming time also bean backstory would great read book really intrigued movie felt like story way offer especially characters like valentine needed lot depth parts felt really hurried disappointing see sequel ender game always favorite book course disappointed movie wish hbo could get hold movie missed entire point book peter valentine subplot book driving force everything ender reason even existed third peter psychopath valentine much empathy book pretty much internal monologue ender brutal calculating like peter win matter empathetic enough like val horrified along way whatever needs done almost destroyed mentally made book resonate much young adults ultimately navigating growing feeling alone worrying fit world movie completely ignores gives us space opera alien story bugger war setting motivation story novel actual plot ender humanity remember watching able believe much missed point delivered superficial kids fighting aliens space movie ten fucking years ago dies old age late could adapt bean books series crave movie way makes suck yeah ruining ending dumb move fact made bean random easily impressed kid bothers end true books think would fine one shot movie put capable directing hands better screenwriter knows cut missed lot subplot sure nature taking book film extremely bizarre card held adaptations long time due studios wanted movie every time critical issues 1 showing passage time everything seems strung together really quick period time passage time overarching issue film rarely captures end miniseries would suit better 2 absolutely wear tear ender end result book weary soul worn left nothing emotional mental wreckage final moment devastation happens absolutely gravity entire enders story takes place 3000 years could 4 5 season show cover strongly recommend reading books yes creator complete idiot lunatic detract great series books high budget hbo series would better story breathe expound crucial elements story relationships siblings constant mental anguish internal conflict time flesh jeesh unique relationships one like petra ali bean etc honestly think r rated dramatic animated film live action way get quality child actors ages stated book changes bernard bonzo madrid incredibly harmed themes book remained bloody details ender game would perfect vehicle show animated movies geared adult audiences could worked instead toned material aged kids point end product flat good obligatory osc piece shit way discussion first production committee responsible adapting book clearly everything tight budget tight schedule bet ridiculous percentage money went paying corpse harrison ford show film add approximately nothing also clearly care military tactical political stuff gets told brilliantly book creates huge part identity making ender game rather solely flashy cgi space battles movie focused movie felt like lazy half baked cash grab follow wake young adult novel movie adaptations cash cows time like stupid vampire books jennifer lawrence series point mini series format could benefit ender game giving screen time stretch legs allow story make script anyone adapts movie include hollywood sci fi explosions sure enders game enders shadow time showing parallel stories start pairs books bringing characters together although need better conclusion osc book felt pretty anti climactic given epicness everything else yeah also think speaker series would work well adult targeted animated scifi fantasy series especially time skips young children characters would great sadly us tv movie industry wants adult animation raunchy comedies series would allowed bean enders shadow hell good read even get much love absolutely tv series would also work great bean shadow seires book series good hope gets revisited film point would love speaker dead

impact ender game pre teens children ender like 8 goes battle school would hard mass audiences watch 8 year old go shit let alone fact ender kills another kid think biggest failure movie cutting much book would adequately impact viewer realization fighting real war along real people died simulation oh think right would amazing mini series always happy somehow nailed casting mazer rackham head always ben kingsley still blows mind things books much denser medium movies tv lot story tell book urge turn one book one movie great chances going cut lot content anything originally imagined

needed miniseries mean two battle school fights could spent several episodes jockeying army positions strategy developing dragon agreed movie rushed garbage harrison ford looked like forced play part screwed many parts book said say movies short stories tv shows novels oh prefer version story without deep dive peter valentine activities need watch movie sure reading book recently yes would definitely time develop lot story points got cut final script much book internal conflict internal strategizing great storytelling film think studio thought franchise move came severely disappointed box office critical consensus card became radioactive way clearly get ahead book still science fiction top 10 paperback best seller month month going 2023 book reading public seems less concerned movie going public ender game one modern science fiction novels cross popular success even dad loved something grabs people walks life whatever movie could tap perhaps illusion kids things book shattered made real movie think miniseries would help think strings would visible longer ran lol opinion movie much long short story plot doomed start 75 book internal narration put film without cheesy imagine ender sitting bunk night talking even worse voice walking hall movie terrible completely missed tone book visuals indeed cool though hey worked pos ender game favorite osc book really think ender saga translates well film screen due heavy philosophical psychological narratives shadow saga action drama could work much better hardest part obviously casting bean fuck yes saying thing years one hundred percent agree liked movie think popular books better series movie adoptions dune split two three 3 hour long movies much justice one 2 hour movie ever could said made tv children dune miniseries back early 2000s awesome disappointed movie left much book included thought bad general way book real trauma pg 13 restrictive maybe would work leeway hbo max series get liked battle
